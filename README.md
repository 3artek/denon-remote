# Denon Remote
CLI for my Denon AVR-X1000.

```
$ npm install jtangelder/denon-remote -g
$ denon help
```

## How does this works?
You can control the receiver with a telnet connection, on port 23.
The receiver needs to be on the network and the network remote option has to be on.

See protocol.pdf for extra commands and documentation.

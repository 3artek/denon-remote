# Denon Remote
CLI for Denon AVR-X1000.

```
$ npm install jtangelder/denon-remote -g
$ denon
```

## How does this works?
You can control the receiver with a telnet connection on port 23. The receiver needs to be connected to your network and the Network Remote option has to be turned on.

See protocol.pdf for extra commands and documentation.
